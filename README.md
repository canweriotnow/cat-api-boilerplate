fluffy asshole animals? Please fork and contribute in any way you can!

## Dependencies

You will need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) before using this
Boilerplate.

## Getting started

To get started, simply clone this repo and run the following command

``` bash
npm install
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, simply run the API server

``` bash
node api
```

Once the API server is running, you can access the REST API:

* `/all` Will return all Cat images

* `/random` Will return a random Cat image

* `/img/:src` Will return the actual image so you can embed in an `<img/>` tag.
